The Temperature Converter is a user-friendly web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales.

The user interface is designed using HTML and CSS, with clean and responsive styling that adapts to different screen sizes. The main input field allows users to enter the temperature value they want to convert. Below the input field, there are three buttons labeled "Celsius," "Fahrenheit," and "Kelvin," representing the target temperature scales.

JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the application. When the user enters a temperature value, an event listener captures the click event and triggers the corresponding conversion function.
The conversion logic is implemented in JavaScript, which calculates the converted temperature based on the selected scale.

The converted temperature is then displayed in a designated output area on the web page. Additionally, appropriate error handling is incorporated to handle cases where invalid input is provided or unexpected behavior occurs.

Overall, the Temperature Converter is a practical example of combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and user-friendly web application for converting temperatures across different scales.
